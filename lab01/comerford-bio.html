        Hello, my name is Alex Comerford. I am a junior in the iSchool, studying Applied Data Analytics. My concentration is <br>
        web development and management. I recently was named to the All-ACC academic team for my competition in the ACC for  <br>
        cross country and track. My hobbies include running, watching professional and collegiate sports. I am in the middle <br>
        of the show Ozark, waiting for a new season to release. I have four siblings and am originally from Kalamazoo, MI.
