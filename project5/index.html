    <p>
        Alamo Running is a running camp that looks to take from the experiences of college athletes and pass this knowledge onto high school and below athletes. This was created out of a passion for running and a love for trying to make other people around us better. The sport of running is what we love and continue to do every single day and is the most important thing that we believe in at Alamo Running.
